# GME (GameStop) Stock Price War Between Wall Street and Traders
For this assignment, I decide to research and discuss about the popular news that everyone knows about that happened recently -- the war going on for GME stock. I had searched and picked two news journal articles, that have different point of view on this same event, and I'll dicuss about my opinions on them later in this file.

## Article 1
From Seeking Alpha's [GameStop: Big Upside In (Almost) Any Scenario](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4402629-gamestop-big-upside-in-almost-scenario), the author stated his thesis on what GME could do in the future to have maximum profit from this war. He stated that GME will be able to issue stock at a cheap cost of capital, which GME would have 75.2 million diluted shares outstanding, and for a net cash position of $19,95 per share.

From my opinion, this article states the right fact from the point of view from a professional stock trader. The article includeds enough data to prove and used for future stock price prediction. GME indeed have a lot of space for profit, giving this chance of rocket speed rising stock prices and stock buying.

## Article 2
Compare to Bloomberg Wealth's article [Cambridge Analytica, the Election Interference Operation That Wasn't](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/gamestop-gme-amc-share-price-sell-or-hold-the-line-on-reddit-stocks) on the same event, these two articles basically holds the same opinion, but from a different view. In this article, a lot of people that are normal traders that joined the war, or people that were already professional business men, were discussing about what they think about whether to sell or hold the stock from GME.

In the article, Noah Williams, a 36-year-old trader, states his opinion that there's still a lot of space for GME stock to go up. Furthermore, he's now emotionally connected to the stock and its opportunity of raising. However, data from this article shows that there's more than 95% of the GME stock value were predicted to lose in the coming year.

Therefore, even though there's still space for the GME stock, my personal opinion will be the same with this data. That people should start to sell the stocks around the time when this event start to go off, therefore to keep max profit before the Wall Street organizations starts to take actions.
